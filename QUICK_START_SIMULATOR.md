# Quick Start: Bipartite Graph Simulator

## What's New? 🎉

Your Hungarian Algorithm Visualizer now includes an **interactive Bipartite Graph Simulator** that visualizes the algorithm step-by-step on a bipartite graph!

## How to Use

### 1. **Solve a Matrix**
```
1. Select matrix size (3×3 to 8×8)
2. Load Example or Generate Random matrix
3. Click "Solve Algorithm"
```

### 2. **View the Simulator**
After solving, scroll down to find the **"Bipartite Graph Simulator"** panel below the Analytics Dashboard.

### 3. **Explore the Steps**
The simulator shows **7 key steps** of the Hungarian algorithm:

| Step | What Happens | Visual Cue |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | Create bipartite graph | All edges shown |
| 2a | Row reduction | Orange edges appear |
| 2b | Column reduction | More orange edges |
| 3 | Find matching | Green edges selected |
| 4 | Check if perfect | Status shown |
| 5 | Adjust weights | Red lines show coverage |
| 6 | Repeat matching | New green edges |
| 7 | Final assignment | Complete solution |

### 4. **Navigate Steps**
Use the controls:
- **��️** First step
- **◀️** Previous step
- **▶️** Play/Pause (auto-advance)
- **▶** Next step
- **⏭️** Last step

### 5. **Adjust Speed**
Slider from 1 (slow) to 10 (fast) - default is 5

## Visual Guide

### Node Colors
- 🔵 **Blue circles** = Workers (left side)
- 🔴 **Red circles** = Tasks (right side)

### Edge Colors
- 🟠 **Orange lines** = Zero-weight edges (potential assignments)
- 🟢 **Green lines** = Matching edges (selected assignments)
- ⚫ **Gray lines** = Regular edges (non-zero weights)

### Numbers on Edges
- Show the cost/weight of each edge
- Red numbers = Zero-weight edges

## Example Walkthrough

### For a 3×3 Matrix:

**Step 1**: See 3 workers connected to 3 tasks (9 edges total)

**Step 2a**: After row reduction, some edges become zero-weight (orange)

**Step 2b**: After column reduction, more zero-weight edges appear

**Step 3**: Algorithm selects 3 green edges (one per worker, one per task)

**Step 4**: Check if all workers are matched ✅

**Step 5**: If not perfect, adjust weights (red lines show coverage)

**Step 6**: Find new matching with adjusted weights

**Step 7**: Final assignment with total cost shown

## Key Features

✨ **Dynamic**: Works with any matrix size (3×3 to 8×8)

🎨 **Color-Coded**: Easy to understand visual representation

📊 **Detailed Explanations**: Each step has description and metrics

⚡ **Smooth Animations**: Watch the algorithm in action

📱 **Responsive**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile

## Tips & Tricks

### 🎓 For Learning
1. Start with **3×3 matrices** (simplest)
2. Use **Play mode** to see full algorithm
3. **Pause** to examine each step
4. Read the **explanation panel** for details

### 🔍 For Understanding
1. Watch how **orange edges** appear after reductions
2. See how **green edges** form the matching
3. Notice how **red lines** cover all zeros
4. Understand why **weight adjustment** creates new zeros

### ⚙️ For Exploration
1. Try **different matrix sizes**
2. Generate **multiple random matrices**
3. Adjust **animation speed**
4. Compare **different solutions**

## Common Questions

### Q: Why are some edges orange?
**A**: Orange edges have zero weight - they're potential assignments.

### Q: What do the red lines mean?
**A**: Red lines show which rows and columns are "covered" during weight adjustment.

### Q: Why does the algorithm repeat?
**A**: If not all workers are matched, it adjusts weights to create new zero-weight edges.

### Q: Can I export the simulator?
**A**: Currently, you can export the full report as PDF which includes algorithm details.
